      <div class="modal-body">
        <ol>
         	<li>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, any Consulting Services provided by Teq to a Client are subject to and governed by these Network Enabled Device Management (NEDM) Consulting Services Terms and Conditions.</li>
         	<li>The Client shall obtain all necessary consents, permissions, and authorizations to enable Teq to provide the Consulting Services and shall provide access to all staff and data necessary for Teq’s performance of the Consulting Services. The Client is responsible for completeness and accuracy of all information, data, and material provided by, or on behalf of, the Client to Teq.</li>
         	<li>At the time Consulting Services are to be performed: (i) The Client will provide, and shall ensure it has all rights to provide, all necessary working facilities (including, but not limited to, meeting facilities, desks, computers, software, hardware, equipment, telephone, facsimile, internet access, and access to applicable locations, computers, and systems of the Client) to enable Teq to perform Consulting Services at the Client’s premises; (ii) The Client shall ensure that the premises at which the Consulting Services are to be carried out comply at all times with all applicable legislation including, but not limited to, any applicable health or safety laws, rules, and regulations; and (iii) ensure that its employees and contractors cooperate fully with Teq in relation to the provision of the Consulting Services.</li>
         	<li>The Client is responsible to assign a contact person who will be available to answer any questions in person or by telephone and have the authority to make prompt decisions.</li>
         	<li>The Client acknowledges that Level 1 “Free Technical Support” includes a one-time conversation, up to 20 minutes, conducted via telephone, that will offer the Client appropriate suggestions to correct systems, device, or network issues. Teq offers free access to www.opd.teq.com/gettingstarted that provides FAQs and instructional videos to correct issues associated with SMART Technologies Interactive Flat Panel, system, and network settings.</li>

         	<li>Upon completion of the online network survey, if the Client opts not to permit the installation of Teq’s zero-impact network performance analyzer, and the Client agrees to have the service performed at a later date, the Client will be charged a fee of $800.00, and will be provided with a report and revision of the impact statement as defined in the online survey overview.</li>
         	<li>The Client acknowledges that Level 2 “Direct Help” services will help the Client remediate specific SMART Technologies Interactive Flat Panel, system, and network configuration issues and challenges that are introduced by various vendor/equipment deployments and security policies via telephone, WebEx, or on-site. “Direct Help” requires a letter of intent (LOI), provided by Teq, authorizing payment prior to providing any service.</li>
         	<li>The Client acknowledges that Level 3 “Reference Architecture Education Series” is an on-site presentation and round table discussion by Teq’s Senior Network Administrator to address the Client’s specific issues with recommendations, suggestions, and best practices.</li>
         	<li>Level 2 “Direct Help” and Level 3 “Reference Architecture Education Series” Consulting Services are charged in 30- minute increments at $200.00. Any on-site service does <u>not</u> include travel expenses. The Client acknowledges the responsibility for accrued travel expenses and will be provided with the details in the invoice at the completion of service.</li>
         	<li>“Direct Help” and “Reference Architecture Education Series” Consulting Services are conducted and billed by the half hour. Any reference to Days or Daily is equal to seven (7) hours of service. For the duration of the Consulting Services engagement or period of twelve (12) months from effective start date referencing such Consulting Services, whichever is shorter, Teq will provide the services at rates set forth in these Terms and Conditions.</li>
         	<li>The Client acknowledges and agrees that any Consulting Services to be held have been specifically reserved for the Client. Any cancellation or rescheduling of any such on-site Consulting Services requires at least 48 hours prior notice to the date of the scheduled Consulting Services. No refunds of any Consulting Services fees will be given for any cancellation made less than 48 hours prior to the scheduled Consulting Services start date.</li>
